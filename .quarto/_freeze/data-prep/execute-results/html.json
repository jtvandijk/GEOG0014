The data we will be working with for this week's task are downloaded from the [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/) website. \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nYou are expected to work through the following computer tutorial individually, but you will submit this week's worksheet as a **group**.\n:::\n\n## Getting started\nSome of you may already have played around with some GIS software such as [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) or at very least have been introduced to [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) in Geography in the Field 1, but today we will be using the open-source GIS software suite [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). \n\nA copy of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) comes pre-installed on all cluster room computers as well as on [Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers/remote-access/desktopucl-anywhere). Desktop\\@UCL Anywhere is a service that allows remote access to UCL resources for staff and students. All you need is a valid UCL user ID and password, an internet connection and supported web browser. Today we will be using this Desktop\\@UCL Anywhere service to ensure that everyone uses the same version.\n\nLet's get started by opening an internet browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/?brand=FHFK&gclid=Cj0KCQiAip-PBhDVARIsAPP2xc26lB3ONziz2KnCd7Ac1MVjTx66n0Ull4R8oiQqzXzgKnJSqRCwK60aAhmFEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge). Now navigate to: [https://ucldesktop.cloud.com](https://ucldesktop.cloud.com).\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-ucl-desktop-login_5c46c21473efe78ff2908ab0a50fe43d'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![[Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://ucldesktop.cloud.com) login interface.

After this, you click on the Desktop\\@UCL Anywhere icon to start the service:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-ucl-desktop-start_fdf09fb90b3e5889d4503e7d7c48ea2e'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Starting [Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://ucldesktop.cloud.com).

This Data Portal allows you to access and generate tabular data for crime recorded in the U.K. across different the different police forces. In total, there are `45` territorial police forces (TPF) and `3` special police forces (SPF) of the United Kingdom. Each TPF covers a specific area in the UK (e.g. the \"West Midlands Police Force\"), whilst the SPFs are cross-jurisdiction and cover specific types of crime, such as the British Transport Police. Therefore, when we want to download data for a specific area, we need to know which Police Force covers the area of interest for our investigation.\n\nWhen you look to download crime data for London, for example, there are two territorial police forces working within the city and its greater metropolitan area:\n\n- *The Metropolitan Police Force*, which covers nearly the entire London area, including Greater London\n- *The City of London Police*, which covers the City of London. The Met has no jurisdiction in the City of London.\n\nToday we will leave the City of London for what it is because we will look at **crime hotspots** in the London boroughs of [Camden](https://www.google.com/maps/place/London+Borough+of+Camden,+London/@51.5428102,-0.1944449,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48761aec186b9a3d:0x41185c626be66e0!8m2!3d51.5454736!4d-0.1627902?hl=en) and [Islington](https://www.google.com/maps/place/London+Borough+of+Islington,+London/@51.5470193,-0.1444663,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48761b5dedeb3be5:0x54f085cb18ec65c9!8m2!3d51.5465063!4d-0.1058058?hl=en), both of which are not part of the City of London. To download our data, open Google Chrome (**within** your Desktop\\@UCL environment) and navigate to [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/). \n\n::: {callout.note}\nYou are free to use a different browser, however, some the steps below on how to download the files may be slightly different.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-data-police_da99f24124ddb24c8482d50c8171142c'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The landing page of [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk).

After downloading the data, go to your `Downloads` folder and right click on the `crime_met_november2021.zip` folder and click on **Extract All**. The data, which is in a compressed format (`zip`), will now be extracted so that we can use it within QGIS.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-data-police-unzip_f5f2f1b729761116c99d6257e8f24298'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Unzip the data.

Two data sets are available on Moodle: the boundaries of the boroughs in London as well as the London road network. Within your UCL Desktop environment, navigate to the Geography in the Field II Moodle page and scroll down to **Week 08: Mapping London**.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-moodle-w8_720f61d99aa73fee13c9a73ad7c837b2'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Geography in the Field II Moodle page.

Right click on on the first file and click on **Save link as ...**. Give the file the name `roads` and save to your download folder.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-moodle-w8-save_3776b38d8ea87bac79b59bdf976f6ff3'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Save link as.

Give the file the name `boroughs` and save to your download folder.\n\nAfter downloading both files, go to your `Downloads` folder and make sure both are extracted. Your `Downloads` folder should look something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-your-downloads_f476b991695b666ceec8655ff109b76a'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Your download folder should now contain three **unzipped** folders containing our crime data, our borough data and our road data.

In your `Documents` folder, create a new folder `GEOG0014_W08`. We will use this folder as our *working directory*. Now move the three folders containg the crime data, borough data and road data that you unzipped from your `Downloads` folder to this new `GEOG0014_W08` folder. Your *working directory* should look like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-prep_cache/html/fig-wd_b576b01133484e8422246df72b5ebf22'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Your working directory is now all set up.

In the case of a shapefile this is in actual fact a misnomer because a `shapefile` consists of a **collection of files**. Without going into detail: each of these files does something slightly different and the the software we will be using requires needs all of them in order to understand the data.\n:::\n",
