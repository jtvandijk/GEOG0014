    "text": "This week we will be mapping crime hotspots in the London boroughs of Camden and Islington. The data we will be working with for this week’s task are downloaded from the data.police.uk website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are expected to work through the following computer tutorial individually, but you will submit this week’s worksheet as a group.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of you may already have played around with some GIS software such as ArcGIS or at very least have been introduced to ArcGIS Online in Geography in the Field 1, but today we will be using the open-source GIS software suite QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQGIS is an open-source graphic user interface GIS with many community developed add-on packages that provide additional functionality to the software. A copy of QGIS can be accessed through the UCL Application Store on all cluster room computers as well as on Desktop@UCL Anywhere.\n\n\n\nLet us get started by opening an internet browser such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Navigate to: https://ucldesktop.cloud.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Desktop@UCL Anywhere login interface. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nYou can log in with your normal UCL username and UCL password. After this, you click on the Desktop@UCL Anywhere icon to start the service:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Starting Desktop@UCL Anywhere. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nIt may take a few minutes to load, but after this you should see your normal UCL Windows desktop:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Your Desktop@UCL Anywhere. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our crime data, we will use data directly from the Police Data Portal, which you can find at data.police.uk. This Data Portal allows you to access and generate tabular data for crime recorded in the UK across different the different police forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of 45 territorial police forces (TPFs) and 3 special police forces (SPFs) in the UK. Each TPF covers a specific geographic area, such as the West Midlands Police, while SPFs have cross-jurisdictional authority and focus on specific types of crime, like the British Transport Police. Therefore, when downloading data for a particular area, it is important to identify which police force is responsible for that region.\n\n\n\nWhen you look to download crime data for London, for example, there are two territorial police forces working within the city and its greater metropolitan area:\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Force, which covers nearly the entire London area, including Greater London\nThe City of London Police, which covers the City of London. The Met has no jurisdiction in the City of London.\n\nToday we will leave the City of London for what it is because we will look at crime hotspots in the London boroughs of Camden and Islington, both of which are not part of the City of London. To download our data, open Google Chrome (within your Desktop@UCL environment) and navigate to data.police.uk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are free to use a different browser, however, some the steps below on how to download the files may be slightly different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The landing page of data.police.uk. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nClick on Downloads and subsequently select November 2023 to November 2023 as data range and tick the box for the Metropolitan Police Services. With this selection we can now download all crime data recorded by the Metropolitan Police Services for the month of November 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Select the data that we want to download. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the box in front of Include crime data is ticked and proceed to click on Generate file. Once your file is generated you can click on Download now.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Donwload the data. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nSave the file as crime_met_november2023 in your Downloads folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Save the data. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nYour download should be finished within seconds. After downloading the data, go to your Downloads folder and right click on the crime_met_november2023.zip folder and click on Extract All. The data, which is in a compressed format (zip), will now be extracted so that we can use it within QGIS later on.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Unzip the data. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have downloaded the crime data, we need to download some background and reference data. Two data sets are available on Moodle: the boundaries of the boroughs in London as well as the London road network. Within your UCL Desktop environment, navigate to the Geography in the Field II Moodle page and scroll down to Week 08: Mapping London.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Geography in the Field II Moodle page. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Further resources heading you will see two files: Roads for mapping exercise and Boroughs for mapping exercise. Right click on on the first file and click on Save link as …. Give the file the name roads and save to your download folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Save link as. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Save file to your downloads folder. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nRight click on on the second file and click on Save link as …. Give the file the name boroughs and save to your download folder.\nAfter downloading both files, go to your Downloads folder and make sure both are extracted. Your Downloads folder should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Your download folder should now contain three unzipped folders containing our crime data, our borough data and our road data. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nThe final step we need to take is to copy our downloaded data to a new folder. In your Documents folder, create a new folder GEOG0014_W08. We will use this folder as our working directory. Now move the three folders containg the crime data, borough data and road data that you unzipped from your Downloads folder to this new GEOG0014_W08 folder. Your working directory should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Your working directory is now all set up. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roads and boroughs file that we downloaded is something called a shapefile. A shapefile is a file that GIS software uses to store spatial data. In the case of a shapefile this is in actual fact a misnomer because a shapefile consists of a collection of files. Without going into detail: each of these files does something slightly different and the the software we will be using requires needs all of them in order to understand the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile shapefiles are still widely used and many online spatial files are available in this format, they are somewhat outdated. A more modern alternative is the GeoPackage format, and we recommend using a GeoPackage whenever possible.\n\n\n\nWe now have all the datasets we need and are ready to move on to QGIS to create some maps."

QGIS is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. In the search box of the task bar, type in QGIS and click on QGIS Desktop 3.28 to open the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not use QGIS 2.18 as the steps in this tutorial will not work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Open QGIS Desktop 3.28. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nIt may take a little while before QGIS has started, so be patient. In some cases Desktop@UCL Anywhere fails to start QGIS on the first attempt, you may have to give it several attempts. Once QGIS has started, you will see the QGIS interface:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The QGIS interface. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nOn the left hand sizes you see two panels: Layers and Browser. We do not really need the second one, so you can close it by clicking on the x.\n\n\n\nWe can now start by adding our spatial data. We will start by adding our roads layer. Click on Layer &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Vector Layer ….\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Adding vector data. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nClick on the three dots (…) next to the Vector Dataset(s) box and navigate to your working directory. Then go into your roads folder and click on the roads file with the SHP File type. This is the roads shapefile that we want.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Loading the roads shapefile. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nClick Open. Then click Add. If you get a message popping up saying something about “Select Transformations for roads” just click on OK. Now Close the dialog box. You should now see the road network of Camden and Islington loaded:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Roads loaded. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nNow repeat these steps for our boroughs file, making sure again that inside your boroughs folder you select the boroughs file with the SHP File type. You now will have both data loaded, although the boroughs layer will be drawn on top of your roads layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQGIS randomly picks a colour when a map layer is first loaded, so the colours of your roads and boroughs file may be different than the ones shown in the screenshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Boroughs loaded. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have our first set of data loaded, we can reorganise them a little. In the Layers panel, we can drag the roads layer on top of the boroughs layer to change the drawing order. We can also zoom to a layer’s full extent (right click on roads or boroughs &gt; Zoom to Layer), change a layer’s colour (right click on roads or boroughs &gt; Properties … &gt; change the colour under the Symbology tab), and zoom in and out of the map by scrolling:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Organising the order of our data.. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nBefore doing anything else, now would be a good time to save our QGIS project. Go to Project &gt; Save as and save your file in your working directory as crime_map.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Saving your QGIS project. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing we want to do is have a closer look at the crime data that we downloaded before loading them too in QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crime file that we downloaded is in a so-called csv format. csv stands for comma (or character) separated values. A csv file can be thought of as stripped down Excel spreadsheet in which every column of data is separated by a comma. If you open a csv file within Excel, however, it will look “normal”.\n\n\n\nNavigate to your working directory and go to crime_met_november2021 &gt; 2021_11. Now open the 2011-11-metropolitan-street file using Excel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Inspecting our crime data csv. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nBesides a column containing a unique Crime ID as well as the Month in which the crime has been recorded, our crime data set contains several other columns of data:\n\n\n\nColumn\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nReported by\nThe force that provided the data about the crime.\n\n\nFalls within\nThe area in which the crime was recorded.\n\n\nLongitude and Latitude\nThe anonymised coordinates of the location of the crime.\n\n\nLSOA code and LSOA name\nReferences to the Lower Layer Super Output Area that the anonymised point falls into, according to the LSOA boundaries provided by the Office for National Statistics.\n\n\nCrime type\nOne of the crime types used to categorise the offence.\n\n\nLast outcome category\nA reference to whichever of the outcomes associated with the crime occurred most recently.\n\n\nContext\nA field provided for forces to provide additional human-readable data about individual crimes.\n\n\n\nFor us, the main fields we are interested include Longitude and Latitude (for plotting the crimes in QGIS) as well as Crime Type (to filter crime based on type of crime). After inspecting the data, you can close Excel again. Make sure that you do not save the file.\n\n\n\nNow we know what we are dealing with, we can load our crime data into QGIS. To do so, there are several steps we need to take:\n\nGo to Layer &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Delimited Text Layer …. Because our data is a csv file we need to load it as a file in which columns are delimited by a certain character; a comma in our case.\nClick on the three dots (…) next to the File name box and navigate to your working directory. Then go into your crime_met_november2021 folder, your 2021-11 folder, and Open the 2021-11-metropolitan-street file.\nUnder Geometry Definitions make sure that X field is set to Longitude and Y field is set to Latitude. Here we inform QGIS that we are dealing with locations.\nWithout going into further details, we need to tell QGIS which map projection was used to record the crime locations. By specifying a map projection QGIS will know how to plot the crime locations in their correct positions. To do so, still under the Geometry Definitions tab, click on the Select CRS button. You will find this is directly next to the invalid projection message. In the Filter box type: EPSG 4326. Only one option should show up: WGS 84. Select this option and click OK.\nNow click Add. This may take a little bit of time! Click Close to exit the dialog box.\n\nThe GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Loading our crime data into QGIS. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nHere we now have every crime reported for the month November 2021 appearing across all of London. We can zoom to the Camden and Islington by right clicking on the roads layer and opting for Zoom to Layer:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: All crime that is recorded in Camden and Islington in November 2021. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the crime data set covers the whole of London, and even records some crimes in locations outside of London, QGIS may get a little slow. As we are only interested in crimes in Camden and Islington we want to filter out only those crimes that took place within the boundaries of these boroughs, and remove the rest. We will do that in two steps. First, we will export the boundaries of Camden and Islington as a separate file. Second, we will select the crimes that fall within the boundaries of Camden and Islington. Let’s first export the boundaries of Camden and Islington:\n\nUntick the boxes of the roads and 2021-11-metropolitan-street layers in the Layers panel to deactivate them.\nSelect the boroughs layer by clicking on it.\nClick on the Select Features by Area or Single Click button: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Select Features by Area or Single Click button may be found at a different position in the menu than shown in the GIF below.\n\n\n\n\nPress and hold the Shift button on your keyboard and click on Camden and Islington.\nRight click on the boroughs layer in the Layers panel &gt; Export &gt; Save Selected Features As ….\nSet the Format to Esri Shapefile.\nClick on the three dots (…) next to File name, navigate to your working directory and Save the file as cam_is.\nA new layer should now appear and you can untick the box next to the boroughs layer.\n\nThe GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Selecting and exporting the boroughs of Camden and Islington. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing to do is to extract only those crimes that fall within the boundaries of our newly created shapefile:\n\nGo to Vector &gt; Geoprocessing Tools &gt; Clip ….\nSet 2011-11-metropolitan-street as Input layer and set cam_is as Overlay layer.\nClick on the three dots (…) next to the empty box with [Create temporary layer] and opt for Save to File …. Navigate to your working directory and type in cam_is_clip as File name. Change Save as type to SHP files (*.shp) and click Save.\nClick Run. This may take a few seconds. Once the process is done, you can click Close.\n\nWe now have successfully ‘clipped’ the crimes that occurred within the boundaries of Camden and Islington. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Selecting and exporting the crimes that fall within the boroughs of Camden and Islington. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving to our visualisation, we can remove the 2011-11-metropolitan-street layer by right clicking on the layer in the Layers panel and opting for Remove Layer…. We can do the same for the boroughs layer. Our QGIS screen should now look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: We are now ready to visualise our data. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not forget to save your progress once a while!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the shapes of the streets and the outline of the street network, you may be able to recognise some streets already. However, we can also add something called a base map layer. A base map is a layer with geographic information that serves as a background and is incredibly useful when you want to add some context to your map. We do need a little plugin to add this base map. We can do that as follows:\n\nGo to Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins.\nSearch for QuickMapServices and click on Install plugin.\nOnce the plugin is installed you can go to Web &gt; QuickMapServices &gt; OSM &gt; OSM Standard. It may take a few seconds to load the base map.\nTurn off the Camden and Islington map layer (cam_is) in the Layers panel by unticking it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSM stands for OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable geographic database of the world, comparable to Wikipedia but then for spatial information.\n\n\n\nYou now have a view of the street data, pulled from OpenStreetMap, with the crime data drawn on top. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Adding a basemap layer. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing we want to do is get some more insight into our crimes. As we know: the data records crime by type, so let’s use this information in our visualisation:\n\nRight click on the cam_is_clip layer in the Layers panel and click on Properties …. Here we can change the symbology of the layer.\nAt the top of the menu change Single Symbol to Categorized.\nClick on the Value drop-down menu and select Crime type. Note that these are the columns that we have seen when we looked at the data in Excel.\nAt the bottom of the menu click on Classify. All the different crime types now appear, with each their own symbol. Click Apply andExpression click OK.\n\nThe QGIS screen now shows a colour for each crime type. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Differentiating crime types. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nIn the Layers panel, you can now expand the cam_is_clip layer and switch on and off individual crime types by ticking or unticking their respective boxes:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Only crime classified as anti-social behaviour is shown. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we can create a hotspot or heatmap. QGIS can do this automatically by mapping the density of the points:\n\nRight click on the cam_is_clip layer in the Layers panel and click on Properties …. Here we can change the symbology of the layer.\nAt the top of the menu change Single Symbol to Heatmap.\nUsing the drop-down menu, change the Color ramp to Magma for a little more exciting map.\nUnder Layer Rendering set the Opacity to 60%, so to blend the heatmap with the OSM basemap. Click Apply. This may take a few seconds. Then click OK.\n\nWe now have created a rather nice visualisation of all crime in Camden and Islington. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Adding a basemap layer. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting map is relatively dark. For your worksheet assignment you may want to select a different colour ramp or you may try to edit the Magma colour ramp by setting the first colour of the Color ramp transparent: instead of changing the Color ramp to Magma, select the Edit Color Ramp … option. Here you can set Color 1 to Transparent. You can also adjust the colours by playing around with the Gradient Stops in the same menu. Once you are happy with the changes you have made to the colour palette click OK. Then click Apply followed by OK to exit the menu.\n\n\n\nBut what if we only want to create a density map only for a given crime type such as anti-social behaviour? We can do that as follows:\n\nRight click on the cam_is_clip layer in the Layers panel and click on Open Attribute Table.\nIn the Attribute Table click on the button that says Select Features Using Expression: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on Crime type in the Fields and Values drop-down menu. The crime type variable now gets added to the Expression.\nDirectly next to the \"Crime type\" part of the expression type =.\nNow click on the All Unique button to get all unique values that are stored in the crime type variable. Double click on Anti-social behaviour to add this to the expression.\nClick on select Features and Close the dialogue box and the Attribute Table. The selected crimes should now show up in yellow.\n\nJust as we did before with our two boroughs, we can export our selection to a new shapefile:\n\nRight click on the cam_is_clip layer in the Layers panel &gt; Export &gt; Save Selected Features As ….\nSet the Format to Esri Shapefile.\nClick on the three dots (…) next to File name, navigate to your working directory and Save the file as cam_is_asb.\nA new layer should now appear and you can untick the box next to the cam_is_clip layer.\n\nOnce you have a new layer, you can update the symbology again to create a heatmap. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Selecting all crime recorded as anti-social behaviour and exporting this to a new shapefile. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been through the key steps that we need to create the map, however, there are some other things we can do. For instance, if we want to put the borough outlines on, we can:\n\nTick the box next to the cam_is layer in the Layers panel to switch the layer back on.\nRight click on the cam_is layer and choose Properties.\nUnder the Symbology tab we can make some adjustments to the Simple Fill settings: in this case we can set the Fill style to No brush. We can also make the outline thicker by increasing the Stroke width. Once this is done click Apply followed by OK.\n\nThe GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Adding borough outlines to the map. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise we have downloaded some data, created a spatial data object by loading the data into QGIS, made selections to our data (i.e. by clipping out our boroughs and by making a selection on crime type), and we have looked at some of the styling options. The final step is to finalise the styling and get the map out of QGIS. This is done through the QGIS Print Layout:\n\nGo to Project &gt; New Print Layout ….\nGive it a name, e.g. crime_asb.\nA new window opens up. In the toolbar on the left hand side, click on the Add map button: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw a box on the canvas. The crime map should now appear.\nUsing the toolbar on the left hand side, there is several other options such as Add scale bar, Add North Arrow, and Add Legend. There are lots of options to play around with!\nOnce you are happy with your map, you can save your map by going to Layout &gt; Export as Image …. If you get a message popping up saying something about “Project Contains WMS Layers” just click on Close. Navigate to your working directory, give your map a name and click Save. Also click Save on the next window that pops up.\n\nThese steps should create an image which you should be able to find in your working directory. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Finalising a map in the Print Layout and saving a map as an image. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nThis image is now ready to be used outside QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map that we have created now requires some TLC on the styling front. There are many more options on how to style the maps, so do play around with colours and settings when making your maps. Have a look at the QGIS tutorial on Using the Print Layout and QGIS manual on Laying out maps."

We can do that as follows:\n\nRight click on the cam_is_clip layer in the Layers panel and click on Open Attribute Table.\nIn the Attribute Table click on the button that says Select Features Using Expression: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on Crime type in the Fields and Values drop-down menu. The crime type variable now gets added to the Expression.\nDirectly next to the \"Crime type\" part of the expression type =.\nNow click on the All Unique button to get all unique values that are stored in the crime type variable. Double click on Anti-social behaviour to add this to the expression.\nClick on select Features and Close the dialogue box and the Attribute Table. The selected crimes should now show up in yellow.\n\nJust as we did before with our two boroughs, we can export our selection to a new shapefile:\n\nRight click on the cam_is_clip layer in the Layers panel &gt; Export &gt; Save Selected Features As ….\nSet the Format to Esri Shapefile.\nClick on the three dots (…) next to File name, navigate to your working directory and Save the file as cam_is_asb.\nA new layer should now appear and you can untick the box next to the cam_is_clip layer.\n\nOnce you have a new layer, you can update the symbology again to create a heatmap. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Selecting all crime recorded as anti-social behaviour and exporting this to a new shapefile. [Enlarge image]"

For instance, if we want to put the borough outlines on, we can:\n\nTick the box next to the cam_is layer in the Layers panel to switch the layer back on.\nRight click on the cam_is layer and choose Properties.\nUnder the Symbology tab we can make some adjustments to the Simple Fill settings: in this case we can set the Fill style to No brush. We can also make the outline thicker by increasing the Stroke width. Once this is done click Apply followed by OK.\n\nThe GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Adding borough outlines to the map. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise we have downloaded some data, created a spatial data object by loading the data into QGIS, made selections to our data (i.e. by clipping out our boroughs and by making a selection on crime type), and we have looked at some of the styling options. The final step is to finalise the styling and get the map out of QGIS. This is done through the QGIS Print Layout:\n\nGo to Project &gt; New Print Layout ….\nGive it a name, e.g. crime_asb.\nA new window opens up. In the toolbar on the left hand side, click on the Add map button: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw a box on the canvas. The crime map should now appear.\nUsing the toolbar on the left hand side, there is several other options such as Add scale bar, Add North Arrow, and Add Legend. There are lots of options to play around with!\nOnce you are happy with your map, you can save your map by going to Layout &gt; Export as Image …. If you get a message popping up saying something about “Project Contains WMS Layers” just click on Close. Navigate to your working directory, give your map a name and click Save. Also click Save on the next window that pops up.\n\nThese steps should create an image which you should be able to find in your working directory. The GIF below summarises these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Finalising a map in the Print Layout and saving a map as an image. [Enlarge image]\n\n\n\n\nThis image is now ready to be used outside QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map that we have created now requires some TLC on the styling front. There are many more options on how to style the maps, so do play around with colours and settings when making your maps. Have a look at the QGIS tutorial on Using the Print Layout and QGIS manual on Laying out maps."
